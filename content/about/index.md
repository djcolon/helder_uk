I am a T-shaped engineer with a life-long passion for the creation of elegant
solutions to challenging problems. I am a skilled self-learner, constantly
growing with my field. I excel in creative problem solving, drawing from a
broad range of experience to think outside the box. Quality is very important
to me, and the solutions I deliver are accurate, effective, robust, fast and
secure. I am an excellent communicator who is able to bridge the gaps between
disciplines to foster a	holistic approach to technical and business
challenges. I believe strong documentation is key in sharing and retaining
knowledge. I am a self-starter, always keen to take on responsibility where
this gives me an opportunity to	drive positive change.

# My story

Ever since I was little, I liked making things. Whether it was with legos or
QBasic, it was the act of manifesting my ideas into reality that has always been
attractive to me. With computers being accessible, a lot of this attraction was
channeled into the digital realm.

The first program I wrote was with the help of a magazine when I was quite
little. The simple QBasic program would ask you to enter your name. When I
entered my name the computer told me I was great, but my younger brother would
get insulted.

As I grew up I played with many different things. I built simple websites with
html/css and eventually php and Javascript. I built tools and little games for
my graphing calculator and modded Morrowind and the Half-Life games.

After highschool I went off to the Delft University of Technology to study
mechanical engineering. In the end my life took a turn and I never worked as a
mechanical engineer, but engineering is engineering, and the overlap between the
fields is substantial.

In university I started using Matlab extensively, and after a course in
discrete simulation using Delphi I started working part-time as a software
developer at [Evry](https://www.evry.nl/) in 2009, a provider of software for
healthcare professionals. Under the supervision of the Lead Developer there I
formalised my skills in a business environment. Thoughout the years I designed
and implemented various sub-sections of the software, as well as a number of
in-house web-based tools.

In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer. This changed the course of my life and was
a large contributor to who I am today. It forced me to quit mechanical
engineering a few months shy of finishing my bachelor's to fight for my life
and - after that - start on the long road to recovery. I talk about this journey
on a website I created called
[Gevecht over leven](https://gevechtoverleven.nl/en/).
