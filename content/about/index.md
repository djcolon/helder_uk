I am a T-shaped engineer with a life-long passion for the creation of elegant
solutions to challenging problems. I am a skilled self-learner, constantly
growing with my field. I excel in creative problem solving, drawing from a
broad range of experience to think outside the box. Quality is very important
to me, and the solutions I deliver are accurate, effective, robust, fast and
secure. I am an excellent communicator who is able to bridge the gaps between
disciplines to foster a	holistic approach to technical and business
challenges. I believe strong documentation is key in sharing and retaining
knowledge. I am a self-starter, always keen to take on responsibility where
this gives me an opportunity to	drive positive change.

# My story

Ever since I was little, I liked making things. Whether it was with Lego or
QBasic, it was the act of manifesting my ideas into reality that has always been
attractive to me. With computers being accessible, a lot of this attraction was
channelled into the digital realm.

The first program I wrote was with the help of a magazine when I was quite
young. The simple QBasic program would ask you to enter your name. When I
entered my name the computer told me I was great, but my younger brother would
get insulted.

As I grew up I played with many different things. I built simple websites with
HTML/CSS and eventually PHP and JavaScript. I built tools and little games for
my graphing calculator and modded Morrowind and the Half-Life games.

After high-school I went off to the
[Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) to study
mechanical engineering. In the end my life took a turn and I never worked as a
mechanical engineer, but engineering is engineering, and I still use the skills
gained in my formal education every day.

In university I started using Matlab extensively. Then, in 2009 after a course
in discrete simulation using Delphi I started working part-time as a software
developer at [Evry](https://www.evry.nl/), a provider of software for
healthcare professionals. Under the supervision of the Lead Developer there I
formalised my skills in a business environment. Throughout the years I designed
and implemented various sub-sections of the software, as well as a number of
in-house web-based tools.

In 2013 I was diagnosed with cancer. This changed the course of my life and was
a large contributor to who I am today. It forced me to quit mechanical
engineering a few months shy of finishing my bachelor's to fight for my life
and - after that - start on the long road to recovery. I talk about this journey
on a website I created: 
[Gevecht over leven](https://gevechtoverleven.nl/en/).

Still recovering from treatment but in need of a new challenge I joined a
start-up called [EVSmart](https://evsmart.nl/).
I was responsible for all software past the firmware level as well as the
systems this software ran on. I designed and developed a group of applications
running on the charge-points and back-office infrastructure. This system was
responsible for everything from tracking usage, monitoring hardware and
troubleshooting to billing and maintenance tracking. After three years, and
having learned more than I ever have before in such a short period of time, I
realised the lack of work-life balance that came with being part of a small
start-up was not what I wanted from life.

In 2018 I moved from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom, and joined
[Cirencester Friendly Society](https://www.cirencester-friendly.co.uk/) as a
developer. My responsibilities within Cirencester Friendly quickly grew as I
successfully took on various projects, and I am currently the lead developer
working within the rapidly expanding technology department on bringing the
Cirencester Friendly Society into the future.

# Personal

I live in the Cotswolds together with my wife Heather and our rabbit Wilfred.
I enjoy tinkering with software and electronics, general DIY, wood- and
metalworking and staying active.
